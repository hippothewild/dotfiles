dotfiles
-------------------------------
Jihwan Chun's personal dotfiles.

## How-to
Bootstrapper script is written for MacOS.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/hippothewild/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./bootstrap.sh
```

## Note
When running bootstrapper script, all dotfiles and editor configuration files are symbolic linked from files at the repository.  
Make sure you have backed up all the settings if you are running dotfile bootstrapper on the machine you have your own configurations.
